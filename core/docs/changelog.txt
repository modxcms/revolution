- Merged with trunk (0.9.5) at revision 2063.

- Various bug fixes.
- Merged with trunk (0.9.5) at revision 1945.
- [bug fix] Fixed a modParser bug when CDATA wrappers were encountered.
- Add missing webAlert function to new modX class.
- Modify categories save process to get the insert id using $modx->lastInsertId().
- Fix to setup.sql; changed ENGINE= to TYPE= when creating new context table to avoid problems with MySQL versions before 4.1.
- Fixed invalid reference to mergeDocumentMETATags in modResponse class.
- [New feature] Allow custom error handler classes.
- [New feature] Fine-grained configuration options for caching pages, database results, or disabling the cache altogether (see system settings starting with `cache.`).  Turn the different caching options on/off or set a default time-to-live for those items being cached.
- [New feature] Database result-set and xPDO object caching, with support for memcache, native-JSON object caching for high-performance AJAX requests.
- [New feature] Configurable session management with default implementation configured for modSessionHandler, an xPDO-based implementation that stores sessions in a database, and allows a great deal of configurability, by site and/or context.
- [New feature] Contexts allows a site to be organized into sub-sites, subdomains, etc, and override any system settings by context.  The default contexts are 'web' and 'mgr' to support the legacy ideas of front-end and back-end session contexts.
- Introducing the new MODx core built on top of xPDO; this will incrementally replace the entire existing codebase, but can co-exist until 1.0 release and provides about 90 to 95% legacy compatibility for existing tags and add-ons.
