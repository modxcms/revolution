- [New feature] Contexts allows a site to be organized into sub-sites, subdomains, etc, and override any system settings by context.  The default contexts are 'web' and 'mgr' to support the legacy ideas of front-end and back-end session contexts.
- Introducing the new MODx core built on top of xPDO; this will incrementally replace the entire existing codebase, but can co-exist until 1.0 release and provides about 90 to 95% legacy compatibility for existing tags and add-ons.
